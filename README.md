Howdy!

Just a person interested in tech stuff, mostly servers and AI. Long time VRchat regular .veteran strategy/story generator player. Absolutely love Rimworld.
I mod every game. I love modding.
Currently trying to make my own agent engine to create AI npcs that form societies and create lore. and maybe also be useful in MCP settings, tool use is a powerful tool (pun intended)

I dont really like decorating my bio, this was written here by the force of guilt, just reach me out if you want to learn more or chat
