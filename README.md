I am a random person

Currently working on an big amount of side projects that I keep juggling between because... why not?

keep in mind that I use this readme to mostly keep a track of what I am doing because otherwise I feel guilty, still feel free to talk to me about stuff there!

1- my overall infrastructure
I value my infrastructure A LOT. my main server is deployed on OCP, thanks to its genereous free tier vds's and my love towards not using managed services (most of the time...) 
I am mostly working with k8s (using k3s) and I host my Gitea, Nextcloud etc instances there too.
I am actually planning to create a map of my infrastructure and workflow soon

2-trying to learn golang 
Currently, I just use golang for not very exciting stuff to be honest. Mostly for quick services like my audio converter for Minecraft. or some huggingface AI wrappers. buuuuut, thats better than nothing I guess

3-Learning to *SCALE*
I gotta experience the magic of just adding one more service instance soon. probably gonna do it with my audio converter thingy, but its a must. It just gives me so much peace of mind when I try something as a hobby and then use it in actual work. 

4-Networking behind CGNAT. Because why not.
I have spent so much time on this recently, mostly to host my ARK:SE server. I could just buy ipv4 but hey, thats the easy way out ain't it? I gotta do more about proxying and stuff. currently used tailscale, Rinetd, Nginx proxy manager etc

5-CC:Tweaked
I really need to spend more time on this, that mod is amazing!!! currently I have my miners and farmers and crafter set up, but I can create way more, I believe that! I will soon integrate my audioconverter there too so I can control music from web!
